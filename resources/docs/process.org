** Purpose

Make the team effective. Team members decide by themselves *how* they do their work.

** What You Talk About

Tactical meetings can be used to address any operational need: sharing information, giving updates, requesting projects and actions from other roles, etc. Theyâ€™re focused on removing any immediate barriers to get work done effectively and efficiently. All circle members are invited to attend tactical meetings and anyone can bring agenda items. Since the goal is triaging to remove blocks, the Facilitator manages the time and works to cover each agenda item. An amazing amount of productive conversation and work can happen during tactical meetings!
