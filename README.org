* hola-tact-meet

Holocracy has many practical concepts, one of them is Tactical Meetings - structured
way to discuss & action on the ongoing project issues.

We are not using Holacracy but I want to replicate some of its structure with this
program so we can try some concepts in our team.

** Architecture

MPA - Clojure / Luminos framework on backend and HTMX on frontend.

** Prerequisites

You will need [[https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen][Leiningen]] 2.0 or above installed.

** Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

#+begin_example
lein run 
#+end_example
